# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I would reccomend the latest version of JOS at any given point of the time line, the only reason to use an older version of the project would probably be to make use of an discontinued feature which is not available in the latest version.
If a feature is discontinued, it's probably because of vulnerabillities or any other deprecated factor and would not recommend it's use for too long.
